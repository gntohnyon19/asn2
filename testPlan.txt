	 In this case I want my roommate to have the will to cook healthy home meals and save left overs for in case he gets hungry and lazy to cook. I can do this by rich knowledge of cooking. I usually cook twice a week in bulk and store most of it in the refrigerator for moments when I’m lazy and hungry. Me sharing my food with him is something he wants. which  in return make him want to start cooking his own meals and sharing with me instead of ordering greasy Chinese food which isn’t health benefiting. From a nutrition program I did over the summer, I learned that different food companies make food having different prototypes. By this I mean that the same type of food might a different food content such as the levels of sodium, fat, and sugar. Psychological it isn’t good to total remove something that someone is used to suddenly but it is better if we reduce the amount or give a substitute instead. For his case, he tends to like high sugar containing foods and high calorie foods, so a way to help improve his health is by giving making him have these high sugar containing foods in a reduced amount or instead I can advice him to buy the prototype of he normally buys but with less calorie values and less sugar content. Allowing him to shop for the same types of food he normally will buy is also a way of positively reinforcing him by giving him the type of food he wants to also improve his health and behavior which is choosing less calorie contained foods to improve his health.
