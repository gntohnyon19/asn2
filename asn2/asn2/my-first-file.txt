	  Psychological it isnâ€™t good to total remove something that someone is used to suddenly but it is better if we reduce the amount or give a substitute instead. For his case, he tends to like high sugar containing foods and high calorie foods, so a way to help improve his health is by giving making him have these high sugar containing foods in a reduced amount or instead I can advice him to buy the prototype of he normally buys but with less calorie values and less sugar content. Allowing him to shop for the same types of food he normally will buy is also a way of positively reinforcing him by giving him the type of food he wants to also improve his health and behavior which is choosing less calorie contained foods to improve his health.
