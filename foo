I usually cook twice a week in bulk and store most of it in the refrigerator for moments when I’m lazy and hungry. Me sharing my food with him is something he wants. which  in return make him want to start cooking his own meals and sharing with me instead of ordering greasy Chinese food which isn’t health benefiting. From a nutrition program I did over the summer, I learned that different food companies make food having different prototypes. By this I mean that the same type of food might a different food content such as the levels of sodium, fat, and sugar.
